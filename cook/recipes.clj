    :method [
      "This is Paul Hollywood's recipe, and it just works.
      It allows you to make a lovely flaky pastry with a little forthought
      (freezing and grating the butter), and about 30 minutes of preparation time."

      "Put the flour, salt and butter cubes in a bowl and break down the butter using
      fingertips until it resembles breadcrumbs. Without too much kneading,
      bring it together to form a soft dough."

      "Roll out the dough into a rectangle about 8cm wide and 24cm high.
      Put half the grated butter on the bottom two thirds of the rectangle,
      fold the top third over, and then the bottom third, including the butter, 
      on top of that. Roll out the dough again, and repeat with the other half of
      the butter. Roll out a final time, and fold it in the same way but without 
      putting butter in this time."

      "Package the dough in baking parchment and leave to chill in the fridge for at least an hour. Done!"

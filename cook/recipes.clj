    :title "cheat's puff pastry"

    :ingredients [
      ["300g plain flour"
      "pinch of salt"
      "50g butter, in cubes and chilled"]
      ["120g butter, grated and frozen"
      "4 to 6 tbsp water"]
    ]

    :method [
      "This is Paul Hollywood's recipe, and it just works.
      It allows you to make a lovely flaky pastry with a little forthought
      (freezing and grating the butter), and about 30 minutes of preparation time."

      "Put the flour, salt and butter cubes in a bowl and break down the butter using
      fingertips until it resembles breadcrumbs. Without too much kneading,
      bring it together to form a soft dough."

      "Roll out the dough into a rectangle about 8cm wide and 24cm high.
      Put half the grated butter on the bottom two thirds of the rectangle,
      fold the top third over, and then the bottom third, including the butter, 
      on top of that. Roll out the dough again, and repeat with the other half of
      the butter. Roll out a final time, and fold it in the same way but without 
      putting butter in this time."

      "Package the dough in baking parchment and leave to chill in the fridge for at least an hour. Done!"

    :ingredients [
      ["couple of good handful of raisins, soaked in warm water",
      "half a pointed cabbage, finely sliced",
      "two apples, decored and cut into small pieces"]
      ["mayonnaise", "yogurt", "curry powder", "ground cumin"]
    ]

    :method [
      "This twist on the traditional coleslaw is a real favourite,
      and everyone in the family knows how to make it. Adding
      curry to a coleslaw might seem somewhat insane, but it works
      surprisingly well, and the dish makes an excellent side."

      "Put the cabbage and apple in a large bowl. Drain the raisins and add to the bowl."

      "In a separate bowl, mix equal amounts of mayonnaise and yogurt, about 3 tablespoons each. Add about a teaspoon
        of curry powder
        and a pinch of cumin. Finally, mix the dressing into the big bowl."

      "The amount dressing should be adjusted to the size of the pointed cabbage and to taste. Similar, the ratio of
        yogurt
        and mayonnaise can be altered."

    :title "cucumber salad"

    :ingredients [
      ["2 to 3 Persian cucumbers" "sea salt" "&#x00bd clove garlic"
      "2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil"]
      ["1 tbsp red wine vingar" "Freshly ground black pepper"
      "Good pinch of dried oregano"]
    ]

    :method [
      "I pinched this lovely salad from a Stanley Tucci cookbook."

      "With the tines of a fork, score the cucumbers to create some texture and then cut
        them crosswise into
        pennies. Put a pinch of salt in the bottom of a salad bowl and, using the garlic clove, rub it all over the
        bowl.
        Discard the garlic. Place the cucumber slices in the bowl."

      "In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, a pinch of salt, and pepper
        until you have an
        emulsified dressing. Pour enough of it over the cucumbers to coat lightly. Sprinkle with the oregano and serve
        at once."

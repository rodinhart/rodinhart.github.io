      ["40ml olive oil" "320ml luke warm water"]
    ]

    :method [
      "Mix the flours into a large bowl. Sprinkle the yeast on one side, olive oil
      in the middle and salt on the other side of the bowl as to keep the salt away from
      the yeast for as long as possible."

      "Bring everything together by adding the water bit by bit, starting with the yeast side.
      Once all the water has been added, tip the dough onto a floured surface and knead until
      smooth and silky."

      "Cover and leave to prove until tripple in size. Knock the dough back and shape into bloomer.
      Put onto baking sheet with parchment paper, dust with flour and prove until doubled in size.
      Preheat oven to 220C and place a tray with water at the bottom of the oven."

      "Make four deep diagonal slashes across the bread and bake for 25 minutes. Lower the heat to
      200C and bake for another 10. Cool on rack and slice once cooled."

      "This is Paul Hollywood's recipe, and it just works.
      It allows you to make a lovely flaky pastry with a little forthought
      (freezing and grating the butter), and about 30 minutes of preparation time."

      "Put the flour, salt and butter cubes in a bowl and break down the butter using
      fingertips until it resembles breadcrumbs. Without too much kneading,
      bring it together to form a soft dough."

      "Roll out the dough into a rectangle about 8cm wide and 24cm high.
      Put half the grated butter on the bottom two thirds of the rectangle,
      fold the top third over, and then the bottom third, including the butter, 
      on top of that. Roll out the dough again, and repeat with the other half of
      the butter. Roll out a final time, and fold it in the same way but without 
      putting butter in this time."

      "Package the dough in baking parchment and leave to chill in the fridge for at least an hour. Done!"

      and everyone in the family knows how to make it. Adding
      curry to a coleslaw might seem somewhat insane, but it works
      surprisingly well, and the dish makes an excellent side."

      "Put the cabbage and apple in a large bowl. Drain the raisins and add to the bowl."

      "In a separate bowl, mix equal amounts of mayonnaise and yogurt, about 3 tablespoons each. Add about a teaspoon
        of curry powder
        and a pinch of cumin. Finally, mix the dressing into the big bowl."

      "The amount dressing should be adjusted to the size of the pointed cabbage and to taste. Similar, the ratio of
        yogurt
        and mayonnaise can be altered."

      "In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, a pinch of salt, and pepper
        until you have an
        emulsified dressing. Pour enough of it over the cucumbers to coat lightly. Sprinkle with the oregano and serve
        at once."

      Note that a disk is easier to roll out than a ball!"
      "Grease a 23cm/9in loose-bottomed, fluted tart tin. Roll out the pasty to about the thickness of a pound coin, making sure it's
      big enough to cover the base of the tin, the rim, plus a bit extra. Roll about half the pastry around the rolling pin, and slide
      the tin underneath. Gently drop the pastry in the tin, as much centered as possible. Push the pastry carefully into the corner
      where the base meets the rim. Using a little ball of pastry makes this easier. Chill in fridge for 30 minutes."
